;      tone indications.

;      List of durations the physical bell rings.
; dial = tonelist
;      Set of tones to be played when one picks up the hook.
; busy = tonelist
;      Set of tones played when the receiving end is busy.
; congestion = tonelist
;      Set of tones played when the is some congestion (on the network?)
; callwaiting = tonelist
;      Set of tones played when there is a callwaiting in the background.
; dialrecall = tonelist
;      Set of tones played when there is somebody ???
; record = tonelist
;      Set of tones played whenver we feel like it ???
; info = tonelist
;      Set of tones played when information is to be tranfered?
; every other variable will be available as a shortcut for the "PlayList" command
; but will not automaticly be used by Asterisk.
;
; The tonelist itself is defined by a sequence of elements, seperated by ,'s.
; Each element consist of a frequency (f) with a possible frequency attached
; (f1+f2) to it. Behind the frequency there is an optional duration, in
; milliseconds. If the element starts with a !, that element is NOT repeat,
; so only if all elements start with !, the tonelist is time-limited, all
; others will repeat indefinitly.
;
; In tech-talk:
;   tonelist = element[,element]*
;   element = [!]freq[+freq2][/duration]
