These scripts, patches and files were moved off older ASL install repositories. They are being updated.
Read them before you execute them. If you are planning to build AllStarLink Asterisk
from source, they should help.

There is no single script that will install AllStarLink Asterisk from source on your target machine.
I expect if you want to build from source, you have some idea what you are doing. Otherwise use
the apt-get install method

This directory is a work in progress.
