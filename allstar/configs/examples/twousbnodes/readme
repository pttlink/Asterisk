These config files show how to configure a multi-node Allstar link system using 2
USB fobs. Both nodes are configured as repeaters, (i.e. full duplex) in rpt.conf.
4 files are supplied: extensions.conf, iax.conf, rpt.conf, and usbradio.conf
The node number of the first node is 1234, and the second node 5678. rpt.conf,
extensions.conf, and iax.conf will need to be modified with a text editor to change
these to real assigned node numbers.
