This is the Asterisk source package for ACID and LIMEY LINUX

asterisk-1.4.23pre
libpri-1.4.7
zaptel 1.4.12.1

This a patched version of Asterisk to run with uClibc on an embedded mini-itx system and on an ACID automatic install disk.

ACID BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

The build is automatically handled by the astupd.sh script.


LIMEY LINUX BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------

First, unpack this archive in /usr/src on the target system.

If you are doing a new install, then use one of the following targets:

make install_pciradio

or

make install_usbradio


Choose the correct target for your hardware configuration. install_pciradio
is for users with quad radio PCI cards, and install_usbradio is for users with
a modified USB sound FOB, or commercially available URI.

When the build completes, run the savecfg script on the target to save the
Asterisk config files in /mnt/cf/syscfg.tgz so that they are loaded every
time the system boots up.

If you are doing an upgrade on a target already configured, then use this
target:

make upgrade

DETAILS
-------

The supplied Makefile will build zaptel, libpri and asterisk, then install them
in the correct directories. Once they are installed, then the Makefile runs the
svastbin script to generate the astbin.tgz file, and copies it to /mnt/cf.

With a copy astbin.tgz the system will automatically unpack the asterisk
binaries each time it is booted, load the correct drivers, and then start
Asterisk.
